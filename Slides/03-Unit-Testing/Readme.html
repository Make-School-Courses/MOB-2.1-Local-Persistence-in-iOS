# Unit Testing

## Why you should know this or industry application

We all know how time consuming it is to make manual testing. It looks something like this: We build and run the app, navigate a few screens, make a few taps and make sure everything works the right way. If everything is good we move on to repeating the same process for different test cases. With unit testing we can automate some of these processes to cut time in testing while still making sure our app works as intended.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the importance of unit testing.
1. Define unit testing
1. Design & implement basic tests in an Xcode project.
1. Navigate Xcode to create and run tests.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What is unit testing?

Unit testing is a level of software testing where **individual units/components** of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.

A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. (ex. a method)
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Benefits of unit tests

**Q:** What are some benefits that come to mind?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- You can detect bugs earlier and fix them faster.
- Saving time means saving resources and money.
- Users are happy with an app that doesn't break with every update.
- Refactoring is easier and gives you more confidence to improve without breaking.
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What can we test?

- Models
- Methods
- Interactions with view controllers
- UI workflows
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The first unit test - An example

Steps:
1. Create a new project including unit test targets.
1. Move to the unit test file. We'll go over it first.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
When opening the default file in the tests target: What you see here is a **test case**. A test case is a class containing several tests. It's good practice to have a test case for each class in the main target.

```Swift
import XCTest
@testable import SampleProject
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Every test case needs to import the **XCTest** framework. It defines the **XCTestCase** class and the test assertions that we'll use later.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The second line imports the SampleProject module. All the code we write for the app will be in this module. By default, classes, structs, enums, and their methods are defined as **internal**. This means that they can be accessed within the module. But the test code lives outside of the module. To be able to write tests for your code, you need to import the module with the @testable keyword. This keyword makes the internal elements of the module accessible to the test case.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Next weâ€™ll take a look at the class declaration:

```Swift
class SampleProjectTests: XCTestCase {
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The **setUpWithError()** method is called before the invocation of each test method in the class. Here, we can insert code that should run before each test.

The opposite of setUpWithError() is **tearDownWithError()**. This method is called after the invocation of each test method in the class. If we need to clean up after our tests, here's the right place to do it.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Now we can continue writing the test, add the following:

```Swift
func testExample() {
    let someBoolean = true
    XCTAssertEqual(someBoolean, true)
}
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
This test creates an instance of ViewController and assigns it to the constant viewController. Then we call the `XCTAssertEqual(_, _)` function to check whether the result is what we expected.

1. Command + U to run all tests OR click the diamond button on each test.

Xcode compiles the project and runs the test. You should see all diamonds green, meaning all of the tests passed.

### Given When Then

![givenwhenthen](assets/givenwhenthen.png)

**(5 min)** Take a few minutes to improve your tests and make the more descriptive using the Given When Test approach.

<!--
## In Class Activity II (10 min)

Try tests in a playground.<br>
Using the following code, your objective is to write a simple test to make sure we can instantiate TodoItem.

```Swift
import UIKit
import Foundation
import XCTest

struct TodoItem {
    let title: String
    let dueBy: Date?

    init(title: String) {
      // complete initializer
    }
}

class TodoTests: XCTestCase {

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
    }
    override func tearDown() {
        super.tearDown()
    }

    func testTodo() {
      // test making an instance of the struct TodoItem
    }
}

TodoTests.defaultTestSuite.run()

```

## Wrap Up
- Code Coverage, should we aim for 100% all the time?
- TDD discussion, how interested are you?
- Highly recommended to complete the tutorial listed in additional resources.
- Keep practicing with small tests.

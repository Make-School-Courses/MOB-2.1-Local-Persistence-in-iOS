# MOB-2.1 - Local Persistence in iOS

## Course Description

This courses covers how and why to persist data in mobile development. We will learn the various options for saving data locally in iOS including Core Data, Realm, NSCoder, UserDefaults, and Keychain.  Understand best practices in storing and retrieving sensitive data and how to work with the iOS file system.

## Prerequisites:  

- [MOB 1.3](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps)
- [BEW 1.3](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/BEW-1.3-Server-Side-Architectures-and-Frameworks)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Build apps that store information locally on an iOS device
1. Compare and contrast various persistence options such as Core Data, Realm, NSCoder, UserDefaults, Keychain and chose the best options for their project.
1. Identify and use the built in persistence mechanisms in iOS as well as some third party options for persistence
1. Store and retrieve sensitive information in iOS.
1. Learn and understand the iOS filesystem.

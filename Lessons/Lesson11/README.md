# CloudKit

## [Slides](https://make-school-courses.github.io/MOB-2.1-Local-Persistence-in-iOS/Slides/Lesson11/README.html ':ignore')

## Why you should know this

Everything should sync -> We turn to cloud storage

As an app creates data, it can be backed up and recovered anytime.

**What are current solutions?**

<!-- > -->

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe how the technology behind CloudKit works.
1. Set up an Xcode project with CloudKit support.
1. Familiarize with the CloudKit dashboard.
1. Create records.

## CloudKit

Technology behind iCloud.

Moves data from Apple's server to an app and backwards.

Using CloudKit, gives you a backend so that users can persist data between devices.

<!-- > -->

## Why CloudKit

**PROS**

- Create database driven apps with just one tool
- Centralized place where users can share data
- Little server management experience
- Subscriptions
- User discovery


<!-- > -->

**CONS**

-  Not able to run server side code
-  Not cross platform
-  Free -ish

## CoreData & CloudKit

We've learned to use Core Data API to manage data locally in an app.<br>
CloudKit gives access to a large distributed database.

Both are very similar and model their APIs in terms of Objects, Models and Stores.

|         |      CoreData            |       CloudKit               |
|:-------:|:------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| Objects |   NSManagedObject        |     CKRecord                 |
| Model   |   NSManagedObjectModel   |     Schema                   |
| Store   |   NSPersistentStore      |     CKRecordZone/CKDatabase  |

<!--

## NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

- Encapsulation of common patterns used to build sync with iCloud
- Gives us a copy of all CloudKit data to store locally
- Robust scheduling and error recovery
- Handles transformation between NSManagedObject and CKRecord

## Why a local replica of CloudKit?

Fetching from a local store is MUCH FASTER ðŸ˜€

## Creating a new project

![list](assets/list.png)

<!-- > -->

When creating a new project we must make sure to select support for CoreData & CloudKit.

We also need to set up Capabilities:
- iCloud & we automatically get the Notifications support.
- Background Modes

<!-- > -->

## Challenge

Now that the project has CloudKit:

- Create a Custom container for the app.

Create two new records:

- **Category** (title, order)
- **Post** (title, url, date categories)

- Visualize the newly created records in the dashboard.

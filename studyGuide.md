# Study Guide for MOB 2.1 Final Assessment

**Overview**: Your final exam will focus on the learning outcomes for this course.  Review each outcome thoroughly and ask questions if you are unclear about the outcome or your level of understanding.

**Outcome:** Compare and contrast various persistence options such as Core Data, Realm, NSCoder, UserDefaults, Keychain and chose the best options for their project.

- *Ways we learned about this in the course*
  - During the course you were exposed to different methods of persisting information.
  - Plist
  - UserDefaults
  - Keychain
  - Core Data
  - Realm

- *Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome*
  - Identify which method best suits different scenarios.
  - Be able to compare and contrast various persistence options.
  - Be able to explain how each method works.

**Outcome:** Build apps that store information locally on an iOS device

- *Ways we learned about this in the course*
  - Many classes in this course had a starter project that you needed to complete.
  - The Core Data tutorial was a complete app.
  - Your final project is also a working app using persistence.

- *Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome*
  - Know the basic implementation of each persistence method, you are familiar with the code even if you can't know it all by memory.

**Outcome:** Use the built in persistence mechanisms in iOS as well as some third party options for persistence

- *Ways we learned about this in the course*
  - Classes that covered all Core Data.
  - Class on Realm

- *Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome*
  - Be able to identify all of the components in the Core Data stack, knowing their responsibilities. Try making a diagram.
  - Identify different types of relationships.
  - Create predicates to filter data and then sort.
  - Understand the idea of using multiple contexts and child contexts.
  - CRUD methods in a project using Core Data
  - Mention the benefits of using Realm vs any other persistence method.

**Outcome:** Store and retrieve sensitive information in iOS. & Learn and understand the iOS filesystem.

- *Ways we learned about this in the course*
  - Keychain lesson
  - Filesystem lesson

- *Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome*
  - Explain how Keychain works.
  - Describe how the Filesystem works and how we can save data combining persistence methods.

**Extra topics:**

- Implementing unit tests
- CloudKit - it's role and description of how you can incorporate it to your projects. When is it a good idea?
